X Neural Switcher (http://www.xneur.ru)

It's program like Punto Switcher, but has other functionality 
and it's really better with some varios functions.

This utility is made for X Window System.

It is developed in Linux for now, but we're thinking it will  
work on any *nix system with X11R6 & gcc3.
