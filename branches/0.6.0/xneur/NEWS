I decide to upload cvs snapshot before 0.0.4 release,
so it's be a good news for users, some features avialable now,
some fixes, include memory leaks fixing.
Some optimize, but I find some errors on xlib part ... 
it's hard to me, becuase the following troubles occured -
 - it's not my code and i need to rewite it all
 - i don't known XLib too good for makeing it faster
please understand me - i have no time for this project now, 
i need to quickly education on source code and XLib functions.
But I hope that in some days i will be have a really stable 
version of it project.
