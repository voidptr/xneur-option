 - rewrite all xlib part code to better style and organization
 - separate xlib part from AI part and misc utils. So Why? Think deeper,
 in a future we'll have too much code in one part, it will be mixed, I don't 
 think it's good for us, and this good for layers - anybody can work with his part
 in the project and don't make problems to other developers, and for future - it will be
 simply to sepearate AI part and other to libruary for use from other software.
 - write normal documntation and include it to project distribution
 - make AI ;-) 
 - dynamically support for other languages
 - support for many languages at once time
 - GUI for make settings (it's needed for dummies), and this is fun for developers. Why so?
 ok, anyother software from office/business group has gui, why not to do gui for xneur?
 - Developers documentation
 - AI-Scheme publication
 - Logic language
 - Better config file
 - logo for xneur (Where are there peoples who can do it?)

I think it's all for present days.
